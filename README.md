# FrSky-Telemetry-Mac

This is a simple macOS GUI written in Objective-C that connects to an FrSky transmitter module via UART and displays the received values.

It has been written for my own purposes, so the battery voltages displayed are calculated according to the voltage-divisor values I've used on my micro quad with an RX-F802 receiver. You can easily customize these formulas.
